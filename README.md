## ‚úÖ CDC Synchronization Design

### üîç Description

This project implements a Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) synchronization circuit (`cdc_sync.v`) that safely transfers a single-bit signal (`async_in`) from a source clock domain (`clk_src`) to a destination clock domain (`clk_dest`) using a 2-stage flip-flop synchronizer. The top module (`top.v`) integrates the synchronizer, and the testbench (`tb_top.v`) simulates the design with asynchronous clocks (10ns and 14ns periods) to demonstrate safe signal transfer and potential metastability issues. Vivado XDC constraints (`cdc.xdc`) define asynchronous clock groups and false paths to ensure proper timing analysis.

### üß† Design and Verification Stages

| Stage      | Description                                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| DESIGN     | Implement 2-stage FF synchronizer for CDC       |
| CONSTRAINT | Apply XDC constraints for asynchronous clocks   |
| SIMULATE   | Test CDC behavior with asynchronous inputs      |
| ANALYZE    | Verify timing closure using Vivado reports      |

---

## üì° Signal Description

The following signals are defined in the design and testbench:
- `clk_src`: Source clock (10ns period, 100MHz).
- `clk_dest`: Destination clock (14ns period, ~71.43MHz).
- `async_in`: Input signal from the source clock domain.
- `sync_out`: Synchronized output signal in the destination clock domain.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

- **CDC Synchronizer**: A 2-stage flip-flop chain (`cdc_sync.v`) to mitigate metastability during signal transfer across clock domains.
- **Testbench**: Generates asynchronous clocks (`clk_src`, `clk_dest`) and input signal transitions (`async_in`) to test synchronization behavior (`tb_top.v`).
- **XDC Constraints**: Defines clock periods and asynchronous clock groups, with false paths to prevent incorrect timing analysis (`cdc.xdc`).
- **Simulation**: Captures waveforms to visualize safe synchronization and potential glitches.
- **Timing Analysis**: Uses Vivado timing reports to check slack and ensure no critical path violations.

## üöÄ How to Simulate (Xilinx Vivado)

1. Open **Xilinx Vivado** (e.g., Vivado 2023.2 or compatible version).
2. Create a New Project:
   - Select "RTL Project" and enable "Do not specify sources at this time."
3. Add Source Files:
   - Add `top.v`, `cdc_sync.v`, and `tb_top.v` to the project.
   - Set `tb_top.v` as the top module for simulation.
   - Add `cdc.xdc` as the constraints file.
4. Configure Simulation:
   - In the "Simulation" settings, select the Vivado Simulator.
   - Add waveform dumping in `tb_top.v`:
     ```verilog
     initial begin
         $dumpfile("cdc.vcd");
         $dumpvars(0, tb_top);
         $monitor("Time=%0t clk_src=%b clk_dest=%b async_in=%b sync_out=%b", $time, clk_src, clk_dest, async_in, sync_out);
     end
     ```
5. Run Simulation:
   - Click "Run Simulation" ‚Üí "Run Behavioral Simulation."
   - Inspect waveforms for `clk_src`, `clk_dest`, `async_in`, and `sync_out`.
6. Analyze Timing:
   - Run synthesis and implementation in Vivado.
   - Generate timing summary report and save as `timing_reports/timing_summary.txt`.
   - Save waveform as `screenshots/cdc_waveform.png`.

## üìä Example Behavior

Example simulation sequence:

| Time (ns) | clk_src | clk_dest | async_in | sync_out |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| 0         | 0       | 0        | 0        | 0        |
| 10        | 1       | 0        | 1        | 0        |
| 14        | 0       | 1        | 1        | 0        |
| 28        | 0       | 1        | 1        | 1        |
| 35        | 1       | 0        | 0        | 1        |

> The testbench verifies that `sync_out` transitions safely in the `clk_dest` domain, with a 2-cycle delay due to the synchronizer.

## üñ•Ô∏è timing report

![timing report ](timingreport.png)

‚è∞ Timing Report Analysis

The timing report, generated from Vivado implementation, provides critical insights into the design's performance. The latest report shows

Worst Negative Slack (WNS): 13.366 ns, indicating the most critical path delay exceeds the clock period, requiring further optimization.

Worst Hold Slack (WHS): 0.152 ns, showing a tight hold time margin that should be monitored.

Worst Pulse Width Slack (WPWS): 6.650 ns, suggesting potential pulse width violations affecting signal integrity.

Total Failing Endpoints: 0 for setup and hold, but 3 for pulse width, indicating issues with signal pulse durations.

Total Endpoints: 1 for setup and hold, 3 for pulse width, reflecting the design's timing constraints coverage.

This analysis confirms that while setup and hold times are met, pulse width violations need attention. Adjustments to the clock constraints or synchronizer design may be necessary to improve timing closure.
